# Contribute to an extension

It's not always necessary to create a new extension. Occassionally something similar already exists in our store. Then you can simply contribute to the existing extension instead of building your own from scratch. This is possible because all extensions in the store are available in this [open source repository](https://github.com/raycast/extensions).
