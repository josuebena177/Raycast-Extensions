# Publish an extension

### Prepare your extension for publishing

Open your terminal, navigate to your extension directory and run `npm run build` to verify your extension. The command should complete without any errors.

{% hint style="info" %}
`npm run build` validates your extension for distribution without publishing it to the store. Read more about it [here](../information/cli.md#build).
{% endhint %}

### Publish your extension

To share your extension with others, you need to open a pull request in our [repository](https://github.com/raycast/extensions). For this, [fork our repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), add your extension to the forked repository, push your changes to your fork and open a pull request via the GitHub web interface against the `main` branch.

### Waiting for review

After you opened a pull request, we'll review your extension and request changes when required. Once accepted, the pull request is merged and your extension will be automatically published to the [Raycast Store](https://raycast.com/store).

{% hint style="info" %}
We're still figuring things out and update our guidelines. If something is unclear, please tell us in [our community](https://raycast.com/community).
{% endhint %}

### Share your extension

Once your extension is published in the Rayast Store, you can share it with our community. Open the Manage Extensions command, search for your extension and press `âŒ˜` `âŒ¥` `.` to copy the link. 

ðŸš€ Now it's time to share your work! Tweet about your extension, share it with our [Slack community](https://raycast.com/community) or send it to your teammates.
