# Introduction

Welcome, developers! Our docs cover guides, examples, references and more to help you build extensions and share them with our community.

The Raycast Platform consists of two parts:

* **API:** This allows developers to build rich extensions with React, Node.js and TypeScript. The docs explain how to use the API to build top-notch experiences.
* **Store:** This allows developers to share their extensions with all Raycast users. You'll learn how to [publish your extension](basics/publish-an-extension.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The Raycast platform is currently in public beta. We stabilised it during a private alpha with our community. We'll continue to work together to nail the nail the developer experience. Join us in our [Slack workspace](https://raycast.com/community).

### Key features

* **Powerful and familiar tooling:** Extensions are built with JavaScript/TypeScript, React and Node. Leverage npm's ecosystem to quickly build what you imagine.
* **No-brainer to build UI:** You concentrate on the logic, we push the pixels. Use our built-in UI components to be consistent with all our extensions. 
* **Collaborate with our community:** Build your extension, share it with our community and get inspired by others.
* **Developer experience front and foremost:** A strongly typed API, hot-reloading and familiar tooling make it a blessing to extend Raycast your way.
